Labor Force Participation and Advanced Education Rates for Women in Asia - World Bank Statistics

### Background
Gender Equality is not only a fundamental right but necessary for society. A visualization that generates awareness of the Gender Gap that exists around the world. We specifically want to focus on women's ability to participate in the workforce. Advancing women’s equality could add up to $28 trillion to global annual growth by 2025 according to the McKinsey Global Insititute. Are societies moving towards greater workforce participation for women? We hope that the visualization **encourages discussion on a very important and sensitive topic.**

Our visualization answers some pertinent questions
- What portion of women in the workforce are educated as compared to men?
- How is workforce participation changing over time? 
- How long until we have equal workforce participation?
- What sectors (Agriculture, Industry, Services) do women and men work in?
